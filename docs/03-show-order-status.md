# Show order status

Your customers can order pizzas, but so far have no way to see the status of their orders. In this session you'll implement a "My orders" page that lists multiple orders, plus an "Order details" view showing the contents and status of an individual order.

## Adding a navigation link

Open `Shared/MainLayout.razor`. As an experiment, let's try adding a new link element *without* using `NavLink`. Add a plain HTML `<a>` tag pointing to `myorders`:

```html
<div class="top-bar">
    (leave existing content in place)

    <a href="myorders" class="nav-tab">
        <img src="img/bike.svg" />
        <div>My Orders</div>
    </a>
</div>
```

> Notice how the URL we're linking to does *not* start with a `/`. If you linked to `/myorders`, it would appear to work the same, but if you ever wanted to deploy the app to a non-root URL the the link would break. The `<base href="/">` tag in `index.html` specifies the prefix for all non-slash-prefixed URLs in the app, regardless of which component renders them.

If you run the app now, you'll see the link, styled as expected:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51804403-60528d00-2258-11e9-8d2b-ab00d33c74cb.png)

This shows it's not strictly necessary to use `<NavLink>`. We'll see the reason to use it momentarily.

## Adding a "My Orders" page

If you click "My Orders", nothing will seem to happen. Open your browser's dev tools and look in the JavaScript console. You should see that attempting to navigate to `myorders` produces an error similar to:

```
Error: System.InvalidOperationException: 'Router' cannot find any component with a route for '/myorders'.
```

As you can guess, we will fix this by adding a component to match this route. Create a file in the `Pages` folder called `MyOrders.razor`, with the following content:

```html
@page "/myorders"

<div class="main">
    My orders will go here
</div>
```

Now when you run the app, you'll be able to visit this page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51804512-c855a300-2259-11e9-8770-b4b8c318ba9d.png)

## Highlighting navigation position

Look closely at the top bar. Notice that when you're on "My orders", the link *isn't* highlighted in yellow. How can we highlight links when the user is on them? By using a `<NavLink>` instead of a plain `<a>` tag. The only thing a `NavLink` does is toggle its own `active` CSS class depending on whether it matches the current navigation state.

Replace the `<a>` tag you just added in `MainLayout` with the following (which is identical apart from the tag name):

```html
<NavLink href="myorders" class="nav-tab">
    <img src="img/bike.svg" />
    <div>My Orders</div>
</NavLink>
```

Now you'll see the links are correctly highlighted according to navigation state:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51804583-ca6c3180-225a-11e9-86cb-58a5a469e3f7.png)

## Displaying the list of orders

Switch back to the `MyOrders` component code. Once again we're going to inject an `HttpClient` so that we can query the backend for data. Add the following under the `@page` directive line:

```html
@inject HttpClient HttpClient
```

Then add a `@functions` block that makes an asynchronous request for the data we need:

```csharp
@functions {
    List<OrderWithStatus> ordersWithStatus;

    protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
    {
        ordersWithStatus = await HttpClient.GetJsonAsync<List<OrderWithStatus>>("orders");
    }
}
```

Let's make the UI display different output in three different cases:

 1. While we're waiting for the data to load
 2. If it turns out that the user has never placed any orders
 3. If the user has placed one or more orders

It's simple to express this using `@if/else` blocks in Razor code. Update your component code as follows:

```html
@page "/myorders"
@inject HttpClient HttpClient

<div class="main">
    @if (ordersWithStatus == null)
    {
        <text>Loading...</text>
    }
    else if (ordersWithStatus.Count == 0)
    {
        <h2>No orders placed</h2>
        <a class="btn btn-success" href="">Order some pizza</a>
    }
    else
    {
        <text>TODO: show orders</text>
    }
</div>

@functions {
    List<OrderWithStatus> ordersWithStatus;

    protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
    {
        ordersWithStatus = await HttpClient.GetJsonAsync<List<OrderWithStatus>>("orders");
    }
}
```

Perhaps some parts of this code aren't obvious, so let's point out a few things.

### 1. What's a `<text>` element?

`<text>` is *not* an HTML element at all. Nor is it a component. Once the `MyOrders` component is compiled, the `<text>` tag won't exist in the result at all.

`<text>` is a special signal to the Razor compiler that you want to treat its contents as a markup string and *not* as C# source code. It's only used on rare occasions where the syntax would otherwise be ambiguous.

### 2. What's with href=""?

If `<a href="">` (with an empty string for `href`) surprises you, remember that the browser will prefix the `<base href="/">` value to all non-slash-prefixed URLs. So, an empty string is the correct way to link to the client app's root URL.

### 3. How does this render?

The asynchronous flow we've implemented above means the component will render twice: once before the data has loaded (displaying "Loading.."), and then once afterwards (displaying one of the other two outputs).

### 4. How can I reset the database?

If you want to reset your database to see the "no orders" case, simply delete `pizza.db` from the Server project and reload the page in your browser.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51804723-5894e780-225c-11e9-9cef-68c15f3f4b2e.png)

## Rendering a grid of orders

Now we have all the data we need, we can use Razor syntax to render an HTML grid.

Replace the `<text>TODO: show orders</text>` code with the following:

```html
<div class="list-group orders-list">
    @foreach (var item in ordersWithStatus)
    {
        <div class="list-group-item">
            <div class="col">
                <h5>@item.Order.CreatedTime.ToLongDateString()</h5>
                Items:
                <strong>@item.Order.Pizzas.Count()</strong>;
                Total price:
                <strong>Â£@item.Order.GetFormattedTotalPrice()</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                Status: <strong>@item.StatusText</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="col flex-grow-0">
                <a href="myorders/@item.Order.OrderId" class="btn btn-success">
                    Track &gt;
                </a>
            </div>
        </div>
    }
</div>
```

It looks like a lot of code, but there's nothing special here. It simply uses a `@foreach` to iterate over the `ordersWithStatus` and outputs a `<div>` for each one. The net result is as follows:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51804902-300ded00-225e-11e9-85b7-6aa2ac764123.png)

## Adding an Order Details display

If you click on the "Track" link buttons next to an order, the browser will attempt a client-side navigation to `myorders/<id>` (e.g., `http://example.com/myorders/37`). Currently this will just log an error because no component matches this route.

Once again we'll add a component to handle this. In the `Pages` directory, create a file called `OrderDetails.razor`, containing:

```html
@page "/myorders/{orderId:int}"

<div class="main">
    TODO: Show details for order @OrderId
</div>

@functions {
    [Parameter] int OrderId { get; set; }
}
```

This code illustrates how components can receive parameters from the router by declaring them as tokens in the `@page` directive. If you want to receive a `string`, the syntax is simply `{parameterName}`, which matches a `[Parameter]` name case-insensitively. If you want to receive a numeric value, the syntax is `{parameterName:int}`, as in the example above. The `:int` is an example of a *route constraint*. Other route constraints are supported too.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51805000-cc84bf00-225f-11e9-824b-348561ccc2fa.png)

If you're wondering how routing actually works, let's go through it step-by-step.

1. When the app first starts up, code in `Startup.cs` tells the framework to render `App` as the root component.
2. The `App` component (in `App.razor`) contains a `<Router>`. `Router` is a built-in component that interacts with the browser's client-side navigation APIs. It registers a navigation event handler that gets notification whenever the user clicks on a link.
3. Whenever the user clicks a link, code in `Router` checks whether the destination URL is within the same SPA (i.e., whether it's under the `<base href>` value). If it's not, traditional full-page navigation occurs as usual. But if the URL is within the SPA, `Router` will handle it.
4. `Router` handles it by looking for a component with a compatible `@page` URL pattern. Each `{parameter}` token needs to have a value, and the value has to be compatible with any constraints such as `:int`.
   * If there's no matching component, it's an error. This will change in Blazor 0.8.0, which includes support for fallback routes (e.g., for custom "not found" pages).
   * If there is a matching component, that's what the `Router` will render. This is how all the pages in your application have been rendering all along.

## Polling for order details

The `OrderDetails` logic will be quite different from `MyOrders`. Instead of simply fetching the data once when the component is instantiated, we'll poll the server every few seconds for updated data. This will make it possible to show the order status in (nearly) real-time, and later, to display the delivery driver's location on a moving map.

What's more, we'll also account for the possibility of `OrderId` being invalid. This might happen if:

* No such order exists
* Or later, when we've implement authentication, if the order is for a different user and you're not allowed to see it

Before we can implement the polling, we'll need to add the following directives at the top of `OrderDetails.razor`, typically directly under the `@page` directive:

```html
@using System.Threading
@inject HttpClient HttpClient
```

You've already seen `@inject` used with `HttpClient`, so you know what that is for. Plus, you'll recognize `@using` from the equivalent in regular `.cs` files, so this shouldn't be much of a mystery either. Unfortunately, Visual Studio does not yet add `@using` directives automatically in Razor files, so you do have to write them in yourself when needed.

Now you can implement the polling. Update your `@functions` block as follows:

```cs
@functions {
    [Parameter] int OrderId { get; set; }

    OrderWithStatus orderWithStatus;
    bool invalidOrder;
    CancellationTokenSource pollingCancellationToken;

    protected override void OnParametersSet()
    {
        // If we were already polling for a different order, stop doing so
        pollingCancellationToken?.Cancel();

        // Start a new poll loop
        PollForUpdates();
    }

    private async void PollForUpdates()
    {
        pollingCancellationToken = new CancellationTokenSource();
        while (!pollingCancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            try
            {
                invalidOrder = false;
                orderWithStatus = await HttpClient.GetJsonAsync<OrderWithStatus>($"/orders/{OrderId}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                invalidOrder = true;
                pollingCancellationToken.Cancel();
                Console.Error.WriteLine(ex);
            }

            StateHasChanged();

            await Task.Delay(4000);
        }
    }
}
```

The code is a bit intricate, so be sure to go through it carefully and be sure to understand each aspect of it. Here are some notes:

* This use `OnParametersSet` instead of `OnInit` or `OnInitAsync`. `OnParametersSet` is another component lifecycle method, and it fires when the component is first instantiated *and* any time its parameters change value. If the user clicks a link directly from `myorders/2` to `myorders/3`, the framework will retain the `OrderDetails` instance and simply update its `OrderId` parameter in place.
  * As it happens, we haven't provided any links from one "my orders" screen to another, so the scenario never occurs in this application, but it's still the right lifecycle method to use in case we change the navigation rules in the future.
* We're using an `async void` method to represent the polling. This method runs for arbitrarily long, even while other methods run. `async void` methods have no way to report exceptions upstream to callers (because typically the callers have already finished), so it's important to use `try/catch` and do something meaningful with any exceptions that may occur.
* We're using `CancellationTokenSource` as a way of signalling when the polling should stop. Currently it only stops if there's an exception, but we'll add another stopping condition later.
* We need to call `StateHasChanged` to tell Blazor that the component's data has (possibly) changed. The framework will then re-render the component. There's no way that the framework could know when to re-render your component otherwise, because it doesn't know about your polling logic.

## Rendering the order details

OK, so we're getting the order details, and we're even polling and updating that data every few seconds. But we're still not rendering it in the UI. Let's fix that. Update your `<div class="main">` as follows:

```html
<div class="main">
    @if (invalidOrder)
    {
        <h2>Nope</h2>
        <p>Sorry, this order could not be loaded.</p>
    }
    else if (orderWithStatus == null)
    {
        <text>Loading...</text>
    }
    else
    {
        <div class="track-order">
            <div class="track-order-title">
                <h2>
                    Order placed @orderWithStatus.Order.CreatedTime.ToLongDateString()
                </h2>
                <p class="ml-auto mb-0">
                    Status: <strong>@orderWithStatus.StatusText</strong>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="track-order-body">
                TODO: show more details
            </div>
        </div>
    }
</div>
```

This accounts for the three main states of the component:

1. If the `OrderId` value is invalid (i.e., the server reported an error when we tried to retrieve the data)
2. If we haven't yet loaded the data
3. If we have got some data to show

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51805193-5c2b6d00-2262-11e9-98a6-c5a8ec4bb54f.png)

The last bit of UI we want to add is the actual contents of the order. Update the `<div class="track-order-body">` and add more content inside to iterate over the pizzas in the order and their toppings, rendering it all:

```html
<div class="track-order-body">
    <div class="track-order-details">
        @foreach (var pizza in orderWithStatus.Order.Pizzas)
        {
            <p>
                <strong>
                    @(pizza.Size)"
                    @pizza.Special.Name
                    (Â£@pizza.GetFormattedTotalPrice())
                </strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                @foreach (var topping in pizza.Toppings)
                {
                    <li>+ @topping.Topping.Name</li>
                }
            </ul>
        }

        <p>
            <strong>
                Total price:
                Â£@orderWithStatus.Order.GetFormattedTotalPrice()
            </strong>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Finally, you have a functional order details display!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1101362/51805236-ea9fee80-2262-11e9-814b-8f92f5dbe0de.png)

## See it update in realtime

The backend server will update the order status to simulate an actual dispatch and delivery process. To see this in action, try placing a new order, then immediately view its details.

Initially, the order status will be *Preparing*, then after 10-15 seconds will change to *Out for delivery*, then 60 seconds later will change to *Delivered*. Because `OrderDetails` polls for updates, the UI will update without the user having to refresh the page.

## Remember to Dispose!

If you deployed your app to production right now, bad things would happen. The `OrderDetails` logic starts a polling process, but doesn't end it. If the user navigated through hundreds of different orders (thereby creating hundreds of different `OrderDetails` instances), then there would be hundreds of polling processes left running concurrently, even though all except the last were pointless because no UI was displaying their results.

You can actually observe this chaos yourself as follows:

1. Navigate to "my orders"
2. Click "Track" on any order to get to its details
3. Click "Back" to return to "my orders"
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a lot of times (e.g., 20 times)
5. Now, open your browser's debugging tools and look in the network tab. You should see 20 or more HTTP requests being issued every few seconds, because there are 20 or more concurrent polling processes.

This is wasteful of client-side memory and CPU time, network bandwidth, and server resources.

To fix this, we need to make `OrderDetails` stop the polling once it gets removed from the display. This is simply a matter of using the `IDisposable` interface.

In `OrderDetails.razor`, add the following directive at the top of the file, underneath the other directives:

```html
@implements IDisposable
```

Now if you try to compile the application, the compiler will complain:

```
error CS0535: 'OrderDetails' does not implement interface member 'IDisposable.Dispose()'
```

Resolve this by adding the following method inside the `@functions` block:

```cs
void IDisposable.Dispose()
{
    pollingCancellationToken?.Cancel();
}
```

The framework calls `Dispose` automatically when any given component instance is torn down and removed from the UI.

Once you've put in this fix, you can try again to start lots of concurrent polling processes, and you'll see they no longer keep running after the component is gone. Now, the only component that continues to poll is the one that remains on the screen.

## Automatically navigating to order details

Right now, once users place an order, the `Index` component simply resets its state and their order appears to vanish without a trace. This is not very reassuring for users. We know the order is in the database, but users don't know that.

It would be nice if, once the order is placed, you navigated to the details display for that order automatically. This is quite easy to do.

Switch back to your `Index` component code. Add the following directive at the top:

```
@inject IUriHelper UriHelper
```

The `IUriHelper` lets you interact with URIs and navigation state. It has methods to get the current URL, to navigate to a different one, and more.

To use this, update the `PlaceOrder` code so it calls `UriHelper.NavigateTo`:

```cs
async Task PlaceOrder()
{
    await HttpClient.PostJsonAsync("orders", order);
    order = new Order();

    UriHelper.NavigateTo("myorders");
}
```

Now as soon as the server accepts the order, the browser will switch to the "order details" display and begin polling for updates.
